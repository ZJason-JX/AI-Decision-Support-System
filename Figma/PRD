# Product Requirement Document: AI-Decision-Support-System (MVP)

## 1. Project Overview
The AI-Decision-Support-System is an AI-powered product designed for high-risk, time-sensitive operational scenarios, such as urban infrastructure risk management. The core objective is to bridge the gap between AI predictions and actionable, responsible human decisions. It operates on the principle that while AI can propose solutions, humans must retain the final decision-making authority and legal responsibility.

## 2. Problem Statement
In high-stakes environments, decision-makers face high uncertainty, severe consequences for errors, and limited response time. Standard AI models often provide predictions without clear actionable paths or a mechanism for human accountability. 

## 3. Target Users
* **Operational Decision-Makers:** Government leaders or department heads handling infrastructure issues.
* **Risk Managers:** System and application suppliers.
* **On-call Managers:** Personnel in time-critical systems, such as City Water system management departments.

## 4. User Journey & Workflow (Human-in-the-loop)
The system follows a five-step "Human-in-the-loop" decision workflow:
1. **Risk Signal Triggered:** External data or system signals indicate elevated risk (e.g., extreme weather).
2. **Risk Overview:** Users receive an immediate understanding of urgency and AI confidence.
3. **AI-Generated Recommendations:** AI provides multiple options (Plans A, B, and C) rather than a single decision.
4. **Human Confirmation & Decision:** Humans select, modify, or ignore AI suggestions, adding contextual judgment.
5. **Outcome & Post-Decision Review:** The system analyzes decision effectiveness and feeds data back into the analytics for continuous learning.

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Risk Overview Dashboard
* **Risk Assessment:** Display system-assessed risk level (e.g., HIGH), trend (e.g., Increasing), and AI confidence score.
* **Key Indicators:** Aggregate and pre-select critical metrics like Drainage Capacity Usage and Active Pumps to support fast decision-making.
* **AI Interpretation:** Provide a natural language explanation of why attention is required based on current loads and historical patterns.

### 5.2 AI-Generated Recommendations
* **Multi-Option Proposals:** Generate at least three distinct plans (Conservative, Balanced, Aggressive).
* **Impact Prediction:** For each plan, predict expected outcomes (e.g., "Lower water level by 0.5 meters").
* **Confidence Ratings:** Assign a confidence star rating and percentage to each recommendation.

### 5.3 Human Confirmation & Modification (Feedback Modal)
* **Parameter Override:** Allow users to manually adjust AI-proposed values, such as the count of running pump stations or evacuation radius.
* **Mandatory Justification:** Users **must** input a reason for any change (e.g., "A-03 Pump Station is repairing") to ensure accountability.
* **Legal Disclaimer:** Explicitly state that by executing, the user assumes relevant legal and ethical responsibilities.

### 5.4 Post-Decision Review
* **Effectiveness Metrics:** Compare the "Goal of Prediction" against the "Real Situation" and the "Final Result".
* **Decision Audit Trail:** Provide a chronological log of the risk trigger, AI advice, manual modification with reasons, and the final system closed-loop result.

## 6. AI Capability Boundary
| AI Handles | Humans Handle |
| :--- | :--- |
| Risk estimation & Pattern recognition | Final decision & Contextual judgment |
| Option generation based on history | Ethical & Legal responsibility |
| Prediction of expected outcomes | Handling exceptions (e.g., equipment failure) |

## 7. Success Metrics
* **Decision Quality:** Improvement in actual outcomes when compared to initial AI predictions.
* **System Learning:** Successful identification of patterns where AI was overconfident or where human intervention significantly improved results.
* **Audit Compliance:** 100% logging of high-risk decisions with associated human justifications.
