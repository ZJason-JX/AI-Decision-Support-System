# Figma Prototypes

This folder contains the high-fidelity interactive prototypes and design assets for the **AI-Decision-Support-System**.

## 📑 Contents
- **Interactive Prototypes**: Demonstrating the complete "Human-in-the-Loop" workflow.
- **Key Frames**: Screenshots of the Risk Dashboard, Recommendation Cards, Feedback Modals, and Post-Decision Reviews.
- **System Architecture**: Logic flowcharts illustrating the integration of AI models and human intervention.

## 🚀 Key Workflows Demonstrated
1. **Risk Awareness**: Real-time monitoring and AI risk level assessment.
2. **AI Recommendation**: Generation of Plan A, B, and C with confidence scores.
3. **Human Intervention**: The "Alter Options" process with mandatory reasoning for audit trails.
4. **Closed-Loop Feedback**: Performance analysis and data回传 (feedback) for continuous learning.
